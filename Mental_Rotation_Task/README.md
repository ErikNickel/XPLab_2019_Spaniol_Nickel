# Mental Rotation Task

In this task we took the departure point and changed it to a basic version of the mental rotation task. 

We follow the instructions to instantiate your own experiment based on the “departure point”, created a repository for own experiment,and change the “departure point” template as instructed. (replaced the 2-alternative forced choice task with a key-press task, instantiated five trials of a key-press task, the key presses are recorded as “same” and “different”, one show one of the mental-rotation pictures obtainable here on each trial
code the key press choices as “correct” or “incorrect” based on the picture shown
add to the trial information (in 03_trials.js) the following information (so that this is shown in the final output; because we might need it for analysis):
number of picture shown
degree of rotation
whether the picture’s objects are indeed “same” or “different”
